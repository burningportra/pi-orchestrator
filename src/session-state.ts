/**
 * Session-state detection and resumption helpers.
 *
 * Determines which orchestration stage the user is in — even after a cold
 * session restart where `oc.state.phase` may have been reset to "idle" —
 * by cross-checking the persisted state against on-disk evidence:
 *   • bead statuses from `br list`
 *   • presence of a plan artifact
 *   • presence of a repo profile
 *
 * The result is a rich `SessionStage` that:
 *   - labels the phase in plain language
 *   - summarises what was completed vs. what remains
 *   - provides the exact follow-up message to resume from that stage
 *   - rates its own confidence (high / medium / low)
