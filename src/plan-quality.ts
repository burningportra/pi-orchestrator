/**
 * Plan Quality Oracle
 *
 * A quantitative "plan readiness score" that answers: "Is this plan good
 * enough that implementation is a foregone conclusion?"
 *
 * The Flywheel guide says the plan IS the product — 85% of effort should
 * go into planning. This module enforces that philosophy mechanically by
 * scoring plans on 5 dimensions and gating the plan→bead transition.
 *
 * Derived from Agent Flywheel Section 2: "Planning tokens are far fewer
 * and cheaper than implementation tokens... Planning is the cheapest
 * place to buy correctness, coherence, and ambition."

### Plan Content

${plan}

### Score on 5 dimensions (0-100 each):

**1. Workflow Completeness (0-100)**
Does every user-facing workflow have step-by-step detail?
- 100 = every workflow is a numbered sequence with inputs, outputs, error states
- 70 = most workflows detailed but a few are hand-wavy
- 40 = workflows mentioned but not stepped through
- 0 = no workflow detail at all

**2. Edge Case Density (0-100)**
Are failure modes explicitly addressed per workflow?
- 100 = every workflow has explicit "what if X fails" sections with recovery
- 70 = main failure modes covered, some gaps
- 40 = happy path only with a generic "error handling" section
- 0 = no failure mode discussion

**3. Architectural Decision Coverage (0-100)**
Does every non-obvious design choice have a rationale?
- 100 = every choice justified with tradeoff analysis ("chose X over Y because Z")
- 70 = most decisions explained, a few bare assertions
- 40 = architecture stated but reasoning sparse
- 0 = no rationale for any decision

**4. Type/API Specificity (0-100)**
Are function signatures, parameter types, return types specified?
- 100 = a developer could write type declarations from the plan alone
- 70 = most APIs have shapes, some vague
- 40 = general descriptions without concrete types
- 0 = "create an API for X" with no shape

**5. Testability (0-100)**
Can test cases be mechanically derived from the plan?
- 100 = test strategy section with specific scenarios and expected behaviors
- 70 = test plan with general coverage areas
- 40 = "add tests" mentioned but no specifics
- 0 = no testing discussion

### Output Format
Return ONLY a JSON object (no markdown fences, no explanation):
{"workflows": <0-100>, "edgeCases": <0-100>, "architecture": <0-100>, "specificity": <0-100>, "testability": <0-100>, "weakSections": ["section name 1", "section name 2"]}`;
